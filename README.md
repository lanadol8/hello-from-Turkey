# Hello Friends My name is Levent Anadol from Turkey
# I am an electronics engineer and 58 years old. I have worked in many companies but unfortunatellyy at the diferent jobs such as;
# Purchasing, production planning etc. I have been retired at the end of 2019 and trying to return to electronics again.
# I have many brilliant ideas due to my long experience in diffrenet sectors and I will share them with you one by one in near future.
# I hope, we together may realise a project and earn lots of money. Obvously I am quite new in Github sites and I have to learn first the # rules and guides how to be used the sites. Best regards to all.
